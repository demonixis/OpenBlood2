# Blood2 Project Instructions

Follow the workspace [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and the [roadmap](../Documentation/Roadmap/README.md).

- This is the new implementation repository. Earlier projects are optional donors, never build dependencies.
- Keep the three project targets small: `engine`, `blood2_game`, `blood2_app`. M1 links original `B2BaseClass`, `CameraSpot` and `Key`. Read [docs/OBJECT_CONTRACTS.md](docs/OBJECT_CONTRACTS.md) before adding classes/services; extend the typed subset and tests together.
- Use plain objects/functions and explicit return values. No EnTT/ECS or manual interface/vtable reconstruction.
- Dependency revisions and archive hashes live in `cmake/Dependencies.cmake`. Resolve the latest SDL `main` when updating SDL and retain the exact SHA for repeatability.
- Keep commercial resources external. Local paths belong in ignored `blood2.local.ini`/`CMakeUserPresets.json` or command-line options.
- Build/test with the presets in README. GPU tests need a real display and must be explicitly enabled. Report headless, private-data and graphics results separately.
- Test the inspector-free Release build when changing application/platform lifetime or UI integration. Keep inspection data truthful; detected archives are not loaded resources.
- Record selective imports in `docs/PROVENANCE.md`; preserve original reference trees.
- Keep the original object and aggregate callback chain intact. Never replace `SetNextUpdate` with callback-return timing or destroy an object inside its callback. Run the object contract suite and Clang sanitizers for lifetime/dispatch changes.
